# Cat or dog? Machine Learning Project

## Brief description of our project
In this project, we are going to use a library of 279 audios of cats and dogs. Our objective with these files will be to create the most accurate classifier between both animal using Machine Learning algorithms, and being able to find the best way to represent audio features in a dataset with numerical values.

For this purpose, we will then create many different datasets that represent all data in different ways and, afterward, we will implement some useful classification models for our purpose with all our datasets. This way, we might be able to find both the best model and the set of features based on the best results our classifiers return to us.
